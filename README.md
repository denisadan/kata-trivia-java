- Played with a Refactoring Kata
- The requirements are taken from: https://kata-log.rocks/bugs-zero-kata

- Game could have less than two players - make sure it always has at least two.
 - A Game could have 7 players, make it have at most 6.
- A player that get’s into prison always stays there
- The deck could run out of questions Make sure that can’t happen (a deck with 1 billion questions is cheating :)
- Could you make sure all places have the “right” question and that the distribution is always correct?
- Similarly changing the board size greatly affects the questions distribution
